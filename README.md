# End-to-End Speech Recognition with DeepSpeech2

This project implements an end-to-end speech recognition system based on the DeepSpeech2 architecture, a deep learning model designed for efficient and accurate transcription of speech into text. The project has been developed and executed in Google Colab for ease of use and accessibility.

## Overview
DeepSpeech2 leverages recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with spectrogram-based feature extraction to model sequential audio data. It is widely used in speech-to-text applications for its robust performance in handling diverse speech patterns, accents, and noise levels.

### Features:
- **Audio Preprocessing**: Converts raw audio files into spectrograms, preparing them for the model.
- **DeepSpeech2 Model**: Implements a deep RNN architecture for sequence modeling and transcription.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Scripts for training the model on datasets like LJSpeech and evaluating performance.
- **Real-Time Inference**: Supports real-time speech-to-text conversion for practical applications.

## Getting Started on Google Colab

### Prerequisites:
- A Google account
- Access to Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/)

### Steps:
1. Open the Google Colab notebook:
   [DeepSpeech2 Google Colab Notebook](#) *(Replace # with your Colab notebook link)*
2. Ensure GPU runtime is enabled for faster training and inference:
   - Navigate to `Runtime > Change runtime type` and select `GPU` as the hardware accelerator.
3. Follow the notebook cells step-by-step to preprocess data, train the model, and run inference.

## Usage

### Preprocessing:
Prepare audio data by converting it to spectrograms using the preprocessing cells in the Colab notebook.

### Training:
Train the DeepSpeech2 model directly in Colab by executing the training cells. You can customize parameters like epochs and batch size as needed.

### Evaluation:
Evaluate the model's performance on a test set using the evaluation cells in the notebook.

### Inference:
Run real-time inference for speech-to-text conversion directly within the notebook by providing an audio file.

## Project Structure
The Google Colab notebook contains the following sections:
- **Setup and Dependencies**: Install required libraries and set up the environment.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Load and preprocess audio datasets.
- **Model Training**: Train the DeepSpeech2 model on your dataset.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.
- **Inference**: Perform real-time transcription of speech to text.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [LJSpeech-1.1 Dataset](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/), a public dataset consisting of 13,100 short audio clips of a single speaker reading passages from various books.

### Downloading the Dataset:
The dataset is automatically downloaded and extracted during runtime using the following code snippet:
```python
data_url = "https://data.keithito.com/data/speech/LJSpeech-1.1.tar.bz2"
data_path = keras.utils.get_file("LJSpeech-1.1", data_url, untar=True)
```

## Results
The model achieves competitive Word Error Rates (WER) on benchmark datasets, demonstrating its robustness across various accents and noise levels. Detailed performance metrics are included in the notebook.

## Future Work
- Implementing more advanced data augmentation techniques.
- Adding support for transformer-based architectures.
- Optimizing for deployment on mobile and edge devices.
